# Introduction

What is UpStamps?

Use [UpStamps](https://www.app.upstamps.com) Feature Flag Management Platform to separate code from different environments and projects. Manage every feature with a central visibility and control user interface. Ship faster with less risk with a simple interface for creating flags with support for different plug-a-play SDKs for your projects.

## Features

- **Create Projects**
    - Integrate different Feature Flags across multiple projects and manage across web, mobile, and server-side applications.

- **Organize by Environments**
    - Separate features deployment across different environments and control their feature lifecycles.

- **Easily Deploy with Feature & Remote Flags**
    - Use flags to test faster in Production, eliminating the risk by maintaining control of the deployments. Use Remote Flags to change real-time behavior of features through response data.

- **Run A/B Testss**
    - Use A/B Tests to randomized experiments with two variants and compare with the users response. Decide by your users feedback which variant is more effective to launch.

- **Target Specific Segments**
    - Control who has access to new features with Segments and define Targets based on Users Device or Location.

- **Easy-to-use Integrations**
    - Integrate into your projects with pre-built components and language SDKs;
